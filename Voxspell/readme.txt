Welcome to the Voxspell Spelling Aid.

The Voxspell application uses, and works on the default working version of Java in the Undergraduate 4 labs.

Make sure the Voxspell.jar file is in same directory as the following files:
-RunThis.sh
-NZCER-spelling-lists.txt
-arrow.png
-big_buck_bunny_1_minute.avi
-final_hey.mp3
-mute.png
-pause.png
-play.png
-stop.png
-unmute.png
-welcome.png
-libs

To run the Voxpell Application, change the current directory to the directory that RunThis.sh is in
(along with the .jar and accompanying files).

Type "bash RunThis.sh" to start Voxspell.
